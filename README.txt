Gesture-based Virtual Interaction System (GVIS) is a human-computer interaction interface that extends the existing interaction methods. It provides a natural and touchless operating experience. The system is extensible, allowing users to customize functions based on their requirements. GVIS also comes with several sample programs that will introduce the concept to guide new users.
